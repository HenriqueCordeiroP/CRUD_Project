# CRUD Project

A simple Web Application that I created in order to learn the CRUD concept and the API concept.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install django.

```bash
pip install django
```

## Run the server locally

```bash
-> On Console:
# initialize migrations
python3 manage.py makemigrations

python3 manage.py migrate

python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Furthermore
I plan to integrate an API for study purposes and also a Front End so it's easier to look at (lol).
